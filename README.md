# Gstreamer x Rust ML libraries for computer vision on video

This repo contains several experimental examples of using gstreamer (via the largely excellent rust bindings) and various rust ML libraries to run computer vision inference on a video stream/file. 
Mostly a personal playground, but maybe useful as an example for someone.
